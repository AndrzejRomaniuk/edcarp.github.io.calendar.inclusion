# Welcome!
At the University of Manchester there are various groups offering training in research computing to researchers and PhD students:
- [Research IT](http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/staff-learning-and-development/academicandresearch/practical-skills-and-knowledge/it-skills/research-computing/research-courses/)
- [Library Services](http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/contact/other-services/)
- [Cathie Marsh Institute for Social Research (CMIST)](https://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/study/short/)
- [Staff Learning and Development (STDU)](http://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/staff-learning-and-development/)

Contact [Research IT](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/) for Carpentry workshops in general, or for training for Doctoral Training Centres.
For Data Carpentry for social sciences the best point of contact is [CMIST](https://www.cmist.manchester.ac.uk/), while [Research IT](http://www.itservices.manchester.ac.uk/research/) will be able to guide 
you and provide information about general Data Carpentry workshops or Data Carpentry for your domain. See our [contact page](/{{ site.baseurl }}/contact) for details on how to get in touch with each of these individual training providers. 

Here, we try to provide information on all things that are happening in the University of Manchester's Carpentry community 
as well as point to events and news from the international Carpentry community.

## What are The Carpentries?
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide with no or minimal prior 
programming knowledge who find themselves increasingly having to write code to conduct their work. In the UK, the Carpentry programme was first endorsed by the
[Software Sustanability Institute (SSI)](https://software.ac.uk/), which still provide support for running and organising workshops and recruiting instructors 
from the wider UK Carpentry community. 

The Carpentries project was formed in January 2018 by formally merging [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/). 
There are now many more new and emerging Carpentries, such as [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) and [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/), 
which are all coming together under the umbrella of The Carpentries. These are all communities of practice - consisting of volunteer instructors, trainers, maintainers, helpers, 
and supporters who all share a mission to teach scientists best practices in writing clean, reproducible and robust code.

Software Carpentry (since early 2000s) focuses on conveying the best practices in programming and writing clean, reproducible and robust code to analyse data regardless of the tools used. In general, topics that are covered by the [core Software Carpentry curriculum](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- Automating repetitive tasks - using UNIX Shell
- Code version control, sharing and collaboration - using git/GitHub or Mercurial
- An introduction to programming and best practices - using R or Python 

Data Carpentry (since 2014) teaches particular and recommended open source tools to do reproducible and scalable data analysis. In general, topics that are covered by [the core Data Carpentry curriculum](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- Best practices in data organization using spreadsheets
- Data cleaning - using OpenRefine
- Data management with SQL
- Data analysis and visualisation - using R or Python
