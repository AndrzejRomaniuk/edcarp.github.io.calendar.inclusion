Find out what is happening in the University of Manchester's Carpentry community.

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are sister organizations and communities of practice focused on teaching computational best practices to scientists. 

Software Carpentry (since early 2000s) focuses on conveying the best practices in programming/computing and writing clean and reproducible code to analyse data (regardless of the tools used). 

Data Carpentry (since 2014) teaches particular and recommended tools to do reproducible and scalable data analysis. Library Carpentry (since 2016, initiated in the UK) is a branch of Data Carpentry that specialises in training librarians and digital humanities researchers.

As the Carpentriesâ€™ joint communities reached over 1000 certified instructors and nearly 50 partner institutions, on 30 August 2017 the respective steering committees approved the merger of the two organisations into a single umbrella organisation with associated lesson organisations and a starting date of 1 January 2018. This will enable the development of related 'Carpenties' under the same umbralla, e.g. Library Carpentry, HPC Carpentry, domain-specific Data Carpentries, etc.
