# Welcome!
Find out what is happening in the University of Manchester's Carpentry community.

# What are The Carpentries?
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) teach foundational computational, coding, and data science skills to researchers worldwide with no or minimal prior programming knowledge who find themselves increasingly having to write code to conduct their work. 

The Carpentries project was formed in Janury 2018 by formally merging [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/). There are now many more new and emerging Carpentries, such as [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) and [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/), which are all coming together under the umbrella of The Carpentries. These are all communities of practice - consisting of instructors, trainers, maintainers, helpers, and supporters who all share a mission to teach scientists best practices in writing clean, reproducible and robust code.



[Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) are sister organizations and communities of practice focused on teaching best practices in computing/programming/software engineering and data analysis to researchers and scientists with minimal or no prior knowledge in these areas but who find themselves increasingly having to write code to conduct their work. 

Software Carpentry (since early 2000s) focuses on conveying the best practices in programming/computing/software engineering and writing clean, reproducible and robust code to analyse data (regardless of the tools used). In general, topics that are covered by the [core Software Carpentry curriculum](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- UNIX shell (for automating repetitive tasks)
- version control - git/GitHub or Mercurial (for code sharing and collaboration)
- a programming language (R or Python) 

Data Carpentry (since 2014) teaches particular and recommended open source tools to do reproducible and scalable data analysis. In general, topics that are covered by [the core Data Carpentry curriculum](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/) include:

- data organization in spreadsheets	and data cleaning (OpenRefine)
- data management with SQL
- data analysis and visualisation (R or Python)

There are many emerging Carpentries now. [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) (since 2015/2016, initiated in the UK by James Baker and now a worldwide movement) is a branch of Data Carpentry that specialises in training librarians and digital humanities researchers. It became an official Carpentry in 2017. There are [various other (primarily Data) Carpentries emerging](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#materials-in-early-development) - [HPC Carpentry](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/), Data Carpentry for [Social Sciences](http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/#social-science-curriculum), gemonics, astronomy, etc.

As The Carpentriesâ€™ joint communities reached over 1000 certified instructors and nearly 50 partner institutions, on 30 August 2017 the respective steering committees approved the merger of the two organisations into a single umbrella organisation with associated lesson organisations and a starting date of 1 January 2018. This will enable the development of related 'Carpenties' under the same umbralla, but following the similar process and sharing the community and resources.
