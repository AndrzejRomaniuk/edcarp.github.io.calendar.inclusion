# What are The Carpentries?

Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry are sister organizations and communities of practice focused on teaching best practices in computing/programming/software engineering and data analysis to researchers and scientists with minimal or no prior knowledge in these areas but who find themselves increasingly having to write code to conduct their work. 

Software Carpentry (since early 2000s) focuses on conveying the best practices in programming/computing/software engineering and writing clean and reproducible code to analyse data (regardless of the tools used). 

Data Carpentry (since 2014) teaches particular and recommended open source tools to do reproducible and scalable data analysis. 

Library Carpentry (since 2016, initiated in the UK by James Baker and now a worldwide movement) is a branch of Data Carpentry that specialises in training librarians and digital humanities researchers. It became an official Carpentry in 2017. There are various other (primarily Data) Carpentries emerging - HPC Carpentry, Data Carpentry for Social Sciences, Doctors, etc.

As The Carpentriesâ€™ joint communities reached over 1000 certified instructors and nearly 50 partner institutions, on 30 August 2017 the respective steering committees approved the merger of the two organisations into a single umbrella organisation with associated lesson organisations and a starting date of 1 January 2018. This will enable the development of related 'Carpenties' under the same umbralla, but following the similar process and sharing the community and resources.
